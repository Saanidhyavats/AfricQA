There is more than one way in which the unborn baby's blood type may not match the mother's.
A, B, AB, and O are the 4 major blood group antigens or types. This is the most common form of a mismatch. In most cases, this is not very severe.
Rh is short for the ""rhesus"" antigen or blood type. People are either positive or negative for this antigen. If the mother is Rh-negative and the baby in the womb has Rh-positive cells, her antibodies to the Rh antigen can cross the placenta and cause very severe anemia in the baby. It can be prevented in most cases.Anti-c, clinically the most important Rh antibody after anti-D, may cause severe HDN. Anti-C, anti-E, and anti-e do not often cause HDN, and when they do, it is usually mild.
There are other, much less common, types of mismatch between minor blood group antigens. Some of these can also cause severe problems.
